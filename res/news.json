        "Content": "From the beautiful city of Porto in northern Portugal, Jo\u00e3o Teixeira knew he wanted to be part of WorldSkills from the moment he first heard about it.\n\nWhile looking for options beyond regular high school education, Jo\u00e3o found CENFIM, the national vocational training centre for the metallurgic and metalworking industry. As he looked through their course prospectus, he was drawn to CAD design.\n\n\u201cEverything you see on the roads or at home has been built by someone, and that person put together a project to build it. And that\u2019s what I like, we can design anything and make it happen in real life. We have no limits with CAD software,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o.\n\nHis WorldSkills journey started soon after joining the centre. He immediately began practising and watching other Competitors, dedicating time to completing Test Projects to improve himself and prepare to compete.\n\nHe competed at the WorldSkills Portugal nationals, progressed to EuroSkills, and finally reached the world championship. At WorldSkills Competition 2022 Special Edition in Bordeaux, France he won a gold medal in Mechanical Engineering CAD.\n\nNow, at 22, Jo\u00e3o is an instructor at the very same vocational centre where he honed his skill. He trains young people from the ages of 15 to 20 in CAD designing, and soon in 3D metal printing.\n\n\u201cWe have recently acquired a 3D printer in metal and I am learning the machine to give training for the others in the future,\u201d he says.\n\nAn instructor during the day, at night he is studying mechanical engineering at the polytechnic to get to the next level. He discovered a passion for cars when he started to learn how they were designed and built and realized that his future would not necessarily be always behind a computer. While he is enjoying every step of the journey, in the long term, he pictures himself managing design projects or heading a production line.\n\nOne of his goals as part of the WorldSkills Champions Trust is to change the public\u2019s perceptions on vocational education and training, and to advocate for policy action.\n\n\u201cIn Portugal, we have lack technicians. Everyone wants to be a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer. We have a lot of engineers that can make the project and select the materials\u2026 But they don\u2019t know how to join them. It\u2019s eventually the tradespersons who teach them how to join the parts,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o.\n\nMany graduates are not fit for the available jobs, and are often left frustrated by pay scales that do not match their initial expectations.\n\nJo\u00e3o hopes to spread awareness of the WorldSkills movement across Portugal and Europe and remind young Competitors that there is more to WorldSkills than earning a medal.\n\n\u201cI was so focused on succeeding that I didn\u2019t talk with many people during the breaks. I never spoke with anyone. And I regret that because WorldSkills is also about meeting new people, from different cultures and I missed on that,\u201d he says.\n\nNow that he is part of the WorldSkills Champions Trust, he says he wants to be the person that makes the group more united and makes everyone feel happy and positive.\n\n"

Their positive attitude to vocational skills, \u201cbrings joy to be here with them,\u201d said S\u00f8ren Heisel, Chair of SkillsDenmark.\n\nIt was also clear young people were increasingly following a green agenda, he said. \u201cIn the vocational training courses around the country, there is a great focus on sustainability, and this could also be seen at many of the competition stands.\u201d\n\nMarch saw a burst of national competitions, including Portugal, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, and the Netherlands.\n\nAs Portugal ended its competition, EmiratesSkills was beginning theirs at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre, the venue for WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017. Over 50 young men and women won gold, silver, and bronze medals in 23 skill competitions. It was the largest national vocational skills competition in the UAE and was watched by the country\u2019s vice president Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed.\n\nMarch concluded with the Grand Est Regional Finals at the city of Metz in France, and the 10th International Abilympics, the skills global competition for people with disabilities, organized in partnership with WorldSkills France.\n\nSkillsLatvia and WordSkills Hong Kong shared the spotlight in April and May holding national competitions on different sides of the world.\n\nFour new skills \u2014 Bakery, Hotel Reception, Freight Forwarding, and IT Network Systems Administration \u2014 were added to the Hong Kong national competition, with the winners now preparing for WorldSkills Lyon 2024.\n\nAlso in Asia, it was the turn of WorldSkills Thailand, whose 29th national competition was held across six venues in late May. The winners were presented with their medals by Boonchob Sutthamanatwong, Thailand\u2019s Permanent Secretary of Labour, who told them this was only the start of a successful life and a stable job. He added: \u201cWe must not stop developing and must learn all the time because the world today is constantly changing. We must adapt to keep up with changes, especially in technology.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, Croatia, Finland, and Sweden held their national competitions in May. WorldSkills Croatia attracted over 10,000 visitors, including students from 100 elementary schools, with an event that included two new disciplines \u2014 Nutri-vita and Tourist destination, specializing in nutritious eating and trends in tourism respectively.\n\nCrossing the Atlantic at the end of May, the Skills Canada National Competition was held in Winnipeg, Manitoba, bringing together over 500 Competitors in 40 skills and introducing a Skills Showcase featuring First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis indigenous skills that included flat stitch beading, soapstone carving, and building mini tipis.\n\nIn June, it was the turn of the Caribbean, with the Dominican Republic also selecting the team for future regional and international competitions from its national competition winners.\n\nFor Jamaica, the first Caribbean country to join WorldSkills, it was their eighth national competition, with 230 young people and 35 skills under the WorldSkills Lyon 2024 \u201cWhere there is a Skill, there is a Way.\u201d\n\nAs WorldSkills International CEO David Hoey told those taking part: \u201cSkills will not only get you a job, they will also help you fulfil your ambitions \u2013 with confidence. Skills can change your life for the better and enable you to bring positive impact into your communities.\u201d\n\n"

Thirty-six projects came forward, some led by former WorldSkills Experts and Competitors.\n\n\u201cINNOVATEP aimed to be a space to celebrate the talent of skilled Dominicans, where they could showcase their capabilities to innovate. The idea was to promote the development of soft skills such as team work and interdisciplinary collaboration, and support them so they would feel free to combine their skills in the way they deemed appropriate,\u201d says Rosanny Contreras, the project\u2019s coordinator.\n\nThe institute engaged an international consultant to provide mentoring and support to the teams in developing the technical part of their projects. INFOTEP helped them in administrative aspects such as project drafting, developing budgets for prototypes, and marketing.\n\nAlexander Grull\u00f3n, a bronze Medalist at WorldSkills America Chile 2018 for Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, came up with a beach fridge.\n\nThe fridge works with an inverter, providing seven to eight hours of cooling without having to be plugged in. A boon for picnickers, ice-cream vendors and shopkeepers, the invention could also be used to transport and refrigerate medicines in rural areas or zones with an unstable power supply.\n\n\u201cThe interesting part is that it has a chip that controls the speed according to the inside temperature. Well, this chip was developed thanks to our colleagues in the electronics department here at INFOTEP Cibao Norte,\u201d explains Alexander, evidence of the type of cross-departmental collaborations that took place.\n\nAnother project, called Vortex, uses a chatbot to streamline communication with prospective VET students. Its developer, Cristian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, competed in Web Technologies at WorldSkills S\u00e3o Paulo 2015.\n\nUsing Google\u2019s DialogFlow technology, he developed a chatbot that goes beyond helping students find the right skill for them and how to enroll.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to obtain metadata on the courses that are most in demand, about demographics of prospective students, or what are the courses that work best depending on regions. This way, we can better plan the offer of INFOTEP and our strategy as an institution,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother of the projects \u2013 a tiny house which has everything a person may need \u2013 was developed between the electrical and the woodworking departments. WorldSkills Americas 2012 Expert in Cabinetmaking, Juan Leonardo, explains that the idea came to them after reading that the Dominican Republic has a 60 percent housing deficit.\n\nTheir project has already attracted private investors, and INFOTEP is providing them support in terms of copyright and patenting.\n\nThe 36 projects have now entered a new phase, where they will receive specific training and mentoring on entrepreneurship. Furthermore, acknowledging the country\u2019s financial obstacles for start-ups and small enterprises, INFOTEP and the Government of the Dominican Republic are working jointly to provide interest-free credits that can help teams accelerate their ideas.\n\nThe Dominican Republic, through INFOTEP, has been a member of WorldSkills Americas since 2010, and of WorldSkills International since 2012.\n\n"

        "Content": "A new study by the World Bank, the ILO, and UNESCO brings together global knowledge on Technical Vocational and Education Training (TVET) reforms to create guidelines for low and middle-income countries.\n\nThe \u201cBuilding Better Formal TVET Systems: Principles and Practice in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\u201d\u00a0report is considered the first rigorous global analysis of TVET challenges and reforms in developing economies.\n\nDespite TVET\u2019s potential to curb alarming global youth unemployment rates and promote sustainable development, the report says that TVET systems in many low and middle-income countries are unprepared for the forecasted rise in demand. The report outlines how large skill mismatches between labour market needs are derived from globalization, technological progress, demographic transformation, and climate change.\n\nTVET systems often underperform due to difficulties facing learners, unsupported teachers, and weak incentives for training providers. Based on lessons learned from TVET reforms and the COVID-19 pandemic, the report offers three fundamental transformations to create better TVET systems.\n\nIt encourages TVET providers to move \u201cfrom striving for recognition, to striving for excellence,\u201d and suggests providers take a client-oriented approach towards both enterprises and learners, prioritize foundational skills, and impart relevant technical skills, and promote an integrated ecosystem that allows flexibility, fosters quality, and engages teachers.\n\nThe report also recommends a focus on end results, which translates into strengthening the government\u2019s role in quality assurance, empowering enterprises and learners to use their client power, and realigning TVET funding to reward reforms and results. Finally, it calls for governments to increase data collection so that decisions and systemic reforms are driven by evidence.\n\nLaunched on 12 July through a virtual event \u2013 \u201cBuilding Better Formal TVET Systems\u201d \u2013 aligned with celebrations around World Youth Skills Day.\n\nThe report was published live by the World Bank Vice President for Human Development, the ILO Assistant Director General for Jobs and Social Protection, the UNESCO Assistant Director General for Education, and representatives from government, TVET institutions, and youth.\n\nIt was then followed by a presentation of the key messages, and a panel discussion under the title \u201cLessons on TVET reforms in L/MICs.\u201d WorldSkills Champions Trust representative for Asia, Shweta Ratanpura, from India, participated in the panel alongside policymakers from Ecuador, Ethiopia, and the Philippines.\n\nShweta shared her experience in pursuing a TVET career in India. While explaining how TVET is perceived as a second-tier track, along with societal and gender biases, she stressed the need for more awareness of the career opportunities, pay scales, and work conditions in TVET careers. This information, she said, is scarce and hard to obtain.\n\n\u201cEnrolling in extracurricular courses and external classes helped me build my skill over the years. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important that vocational training is included in the education system early on. If it\u2019s part of the system more and more people would be encouraged to do the same,\u201d she said as she highlighted the effect of role models to engage more women in TVET.\n\n\u201cIn short, the most important takeaway is to bring change. Whether as a student, or as a parent, educator, or policymaker, we all hold the power to contribute to raising awareness, countering biases, and strengthening our education system,\u201d she concluded.\n\nA recording of the event and related information is available on the World Bank\u2019s official event page.\n\nDownload the full report \u201cBuilding Better Formal TVET Systems: Principles and Practice in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\u201d.\u00a0It will be available in French and Spanish in the near future.\n\n"

        "Content": "To celebrate World Youth Skills Day (15 July) WorldSkills and UNESCO-UNEVOC co-organized an event packed with insights and knowledge from youth on how to better prepare young people for the future of work.\n\nThe hybrid event, hosted in collaboration with WorldSkills Germany, took place on 14 July in Bonn, Germany and online. It brought together former WorldSkills Champions and apprentices, alongside policymakers and diverse stakeholders within the skills landscape in Germany and beyond.\n\nThe opening remarks were delivered by:\n\nAs she expressed her excitement to hear directly from the incredible skilled youth in the different panels, Laurence Gates, said it was their perspective, ideas, and challenging questions that should be heard on World Youth Skills Day, and every day.\n\n\u201cWe are all committed to helping you develop the skills you need for tomorrow, because our world is becoming more turbulent and uncertain. Change will only happen when educators, industries, and policymakers work together to redesign our VET systems for sustainable human and economic development,\u201d said Laurence Gates.\n\nThe first discussion included Aswatha Narayana Sanagavarapu, gold Medalist from WorldSkills Kazan 2019, taking part in a youth focus group on improving teaching and learning processes. With the added insights of a recent UNESCO-UNEVOC youth survey, the panel aimed at amplifying youth priorities and expectations for the future of skills development.\n\nAswatha, who competed in Water Technology, said that his WorldSkills journey was transformational for him.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to my experience as an engineering graduate, I saw that most often the knowledge is limited to the theoretical aspects, and it lacks the practical approach of the real world. Hence, I strongly believe competitions and apprenticeships can do a lot in bridging the gap of knowledge and skills,\u201d he said.\n\nThe focus group was followed by a panel around the theme for this year\u2019s World Youth Skills Day \u2013 Skilling teachers, trainers and youth for a transformative future. WorldSkills Champions Trust representative, Sonya Hill joined from Jamaica to share her experience of transitioning from school to work.\n\n\u201cRegardless of having and engineering degree and having competed at WorldSkills, there were skill gaps that hindered my performance in the work environment. I was provided by a solid theoretical foundation, but I got no exposure to practical experience and technologies used within industry, which made it very challenging for me to quickly adapt and effectively apply my knowledge,\u201d said Sonya.\n\nShe added that to better support youth, TVET institutions should frequently update their curricula, and machinery to match that of industry. Partnerships can provide opportunities for students to develop more practical skills while they are still in school to accelerate their readiness for the labour market.\n\nAs UNESCO\u2019s designated centre for technical and vocational education and training (TVET), UNESCO-UNEVOC supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen and upgrade their TVET systems and ensures access to quality skills training and development for all. UNESCO-UNEVOC is a partner of the WorldSkills Conference Coalition, and a long-term partner of WorldSkills.\n\n"

        "Content": "WorldSkills is collaborating with the OECD to support the development of an international large-scale assessment of Vocational Education and Training (VET) programmes. The project builds on the well-established OECD\u2019s PISA initiative, which has been providing comparative data for decades on the performance of school-level students to help countries drive educational reform.\n\nCountries often struggle to evaluate the success of their VET systems and benchmark them against international best practices because of limited and inconsistent data.\n\nA recent blog post by OECD\u2019s Director for Education and Skills, Andreas Schleicher, and the Head of the Centre for Skills PISA-VET, El Iza Mohamedou, outlines how policymakers need data that covers more than enrolment and labour market outcomes. Countries need to be able to compare their VET systems\u2019 achievement status by country and occupation, identify potential policy action on the basis of other countries\u2019 successes, and compare per student expenditures and outcomes.\n\nOver the next two years of the development phase, the OECD will collaborate with participating countries, organizations, and their experts to refine the focus of the assessment. They will define the targets of the assessments, the competencies to be assessed, and the methodology.\n\nAs part of this collaboration, WorldSkills has put forward one or more current or recent Experts for each of the five occupational fields planned to be evaluated:\n\nFurthermore, WorldSkills hopes to provide expertise in designing tests of the feasibility of the international assessment.\n\n\u201cThe instrumental reason for WorldSkills being involved in the initiative is that we believe in the validity and potential of our assessment model, which we call \u2018performance assessment\u2019,\u201d said Jenny Shackleton.\n\n\u201cThe PISA-test for school children is relatively easy to do online, and to provide very accurate data and feedback, because what is being assessed is relatively limited. But if you simply apply the PISA-test model to vocational education and training, what you\u2019re doing is assessing what people know about an occupation but not their practical skills and proficiency. This is where performance assessment comes in.\u201d\n\nWhile WorldSkills Competitions are a form of international comparative assessment, their focus is to assess young people on the basis of the WorldSkills Occupational Standards.\n\nPISA-VET, instead, aims to assess the quality of national VET systems and programmes currently in place \u2013 whether they are work-based or college-based \u2013 with the goal of improving the quality and attractiveness of VET. It will look into professional skills, including practice-oriented or technical skills, and employability skills.\n\nAt the end of the development phase, the OECD will issue a framework document and a first set of proven and valid assessment instruments that may lead to its pilot phase.\n\nThe OECD and WorldSkills have already partnered in multiple projects such as the Youth Voice for the Future of Work report, and the WorldSkills Conference Coalition.\n\n"

A collaboration between WorldSkills International and WorldSkills China, the WorldSkills Museum is the first in the world dedicated to vocational skills.\n\nDivided into six zones across approximately 2,500 m\u00b2, the WorldSkills Museum will use engaging and immersive formats to tell the story of WorldSkills and skills. The collection is housed in what was once the Wing On textile storehouse - a 100-year-old former cotton warehouse in Shanghai\u2019s historic YangPu district. The building has been restored to maintain its original industrial look while combining innovative materials and modern spaces.\n\nThe WorldSkills Museum project kicked off in 2017 as part of Shanghai\u2019s winning bid to host the 46th WorldSkills Competition. Although progress on the build was delayed due to the pandemic, over the past six years, a dedicated team have identified and sourced more than 700 assets from across the globe, mostly from private collections, former Competitors or Experts, WorldSkills Members, Global Partners, or from WorldSkills International\u2019s archive. These have been complimented by domestic assets identified and sourced by the local team in Shanghai.\n\nWith exhibition construction close to completion and the majority of assets in place, the WorldSkills Museum will start trial operations with controlled groups of visitors in mid-July and is planning its official opening to the general public in November.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to think that we will soon be welcoming visitors and taking them on a journey to increase their level of awareness and understanding of the importance and value of skills throughout history and into the future,\u201d said Mark Callaghan, WorldSkills Museum Project Director.\n\nIn recent visits to Shanghai, the WorldSkills Museum project team worked alongside their local counterparts at the exhibition site.

The collection includes 43 trophies and medals from almost every international competition since 1950.\n\n\u201cThe WorldSkills Museum project has also allowed us to collect much of the history of this organization, especially from its early years. Many have shared their most cherished memories and objects for this project with great excitement,\u201d said Nuria Portland, WorldSkills Museum Project Coordinator.\n\nThe Museum also includes an exhibition focusing on skills development and China, highlighting some of the enduring contributions of Chinese civilization to the world and the country\u2019s commitment to traditional as well as advanced technological skills.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of WorldSkills Shanghai 2022, WorldSkills China presented an updated proposal to host WorldSkills Competition 2026 which was approved by Members at the General Assembly in 2022.\n\nThe next WorldSkills Competition following WorldSkills Lyon 2024 will take place in Shanghai in September of 2026.\n\n"
